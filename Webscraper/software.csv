Queens Canada,"This summer QGEM created a unique ratiometric application program.Our program outlines the steps required to build specific bifunctional E.coli biofilms, based on designated conditions - as deemed by the user. As such, the user inputs the designated ratio of the two proteins to be found in the biofilm, as well as the protein coding sequences, and organism/plasmid. The program then outputs the required promoter sequences and RBS sequences necessary to achieve such a ratio under the given conditio ...",2017

UAlberta,"DNA sequence assembly, albeit slow and tedious, is a critical component of molecular biology and protein engineering. Sanger sequencing, the most commonly used sequencing technique, usually produces 800-1000 base pair reads. This read length usually means that constructs beyond 1kb require multiple sequencing reactions to get the full sequence. As a result, sequencing data must be manually analyzed and aligned to get the entire sequence of a construct. To speed up this laborious, and often dizzi ...",2017
Washington,"Our software is both easy-to-use and easy to modify. User-friendliness was a high priority - much more so than similar ad hoc scientific tools. Our graphical interface requires no special skills or technical knowledge to use. By using Oracle standard Java software development idioms and thorough JavaDoc code documentation, we’ve created a codebase that is easily adjustable by anyone with a modicum of Java experience. In addition, these choices allow platform flexibility. The device can be contro ...",2017
Waterloo,"This year, we worked with U of T to adapt their igemwiki-api into a continuous integration server. This server allows teams to edit their wikis locally and on GitHub and automatically upload them to igem.org servers when changes are made. This allows iGEM teams to write cleaner code and saves them time uploading that code manually. Continuous integration (CI) refers to a continuous process of integrating code after it is written. It is a very common practice in software development because it re ...",2017
