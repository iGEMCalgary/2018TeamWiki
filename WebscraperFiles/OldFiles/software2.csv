Bologna," We develop a matlab tool to analyze such kind of bacterium imagine that can be acquired in different format (jpg, bpm, tiff). For each segmented bacteria the software computes the size in pixel, the mean and standard deviation of  intensity florescence. In the next step the global threshold is computed in order to convert an intensity image to a binary image using otsu’s method. The image is then ready to be scanned, pixel by pixel, to detect bacteria (cluster  of pixels) and obtain informations about their area, fluorescence mean and standard deviation. Fluorescence intensity ( definite by the std\mean ratio referred to each bacteria): this values consent to throw away the bacteria that lie on another focal layer or that aren’t focused correctly.",2008
Edinburgh," However, most tools require the users to convert a designed circuit into a set of reaction equations for modelling. Therefore we developed a web tool called mgec (modeling genetically engineered circuits) to address this issue. Through mgec, one only needs to tell which genes and promoters are assembled in order to form their gene circuit - a preliminary model in sbml format will be automatically generated for the circuit. Therefore the focus of mgec is also on the promoters which link the signal, transcription factor (tf) with the regulated genes. The hill equation is used for the kinetic equation of the production process and mass action kinetics for the degradation.",2008
Newcastle University," One person was lead developer for each module, but the developers worked in the same lab, and had frequent formal and informal discussions in order to develop software which works together and provides the necessary functionality. The workbench takes a user defined structure, together with a desired behavior, and presents this to the evolutionary algorithm. The evolutionary algorithm evolves potential solutions, starting with the provided structure. It generates a range of potential solutions by requesting different parts from the parts repository, assembling them according to information retrieved from the constraints repository, and assessing the fitness value of the mutated circuit based upon how well this satisfies the objective. Once an acceptable regulatory network has been discovered, this model is sent to the model-to-sequence converter, which uses the parts to derive a dna sequence that encodes the necessary behaviour, while satisfying sequence constraints, such as avoiding long duplicate regions that could trigger rearrangements in-vivo, or low-complexity regions that would make dna synthesis more difficult.",2008
Bologna," These specifications are required for the proper engineering of the trans and cis complementary sequences, whose functions are described in the t-rex device. After having generated a 50b-long sequence, baser performs the conformity test to check that the sequence does not contain: a) more than 5 adjacent repeats of the same nucleotide (to avoid transcription errors); b) restriction sites; c) rbs sequences. If one among these conditions occurs, a new sequence is generated until the conformity test is passed. Thereafter the rbs sequence, chosen by the user, is linked downstream of its 3’ end to obtain what is called the “current” sequence. After score computation, five adjacent nucleotides in the “current” sequence are substituted with a randomly-picked block from the bf, originating a new sequence.",2009

As of friday october 28, 2011, both android apps had over 950 downloads worldwide, while the iphone apps had been downloaded over 400 times. For successful and efficient translation, the codon usage of the newly introduced gene must be optimised to match the trna pool of the host organism. However, if one simply picked the most common codon for each amino acid, the rate of translation would likely be extremely fast across the entire gene. For example, it has been suggested that in certain regions of the gene, the source organism may ‘choose’ a short run of rare codons, in order to slow down translation in that region.",2011

We interacted with the public by handing out seed packets in parks, and informing them about the decline of bees and the city by-law that makes urban bee-keeping illegal; many signed a petition that we created to remove this by-law. In southern alberta, bee populations are currently decreasing with reports saying that north american beekeepers are losing approximately one third of their bees each year. As a way to help the bee population, our team made it a goal to try and have this bylaw amended to allow urban beekeeping within city limits.",2015

Toronto," In microbial communities, the survival of all species are interdependent; the biochemical and behavioral activities of one species provides the necessary metabolites and living environment for another[1]. Many approaches have been developed for predicting flux distributions in the metabolic network of one species using flux-balance analysis (fba) in order to optimize for biomass or product formation[2,3]. Flux-balance analysis has been used for a variety of applications, including drug target identification by evaluation of gene essentiality, knowledge-gap filling of metabolic models and metabolic engineering of e. coli for lycopene synthesis[4,5,6]. However, algorithms to perform fba at a community level have been rare and complex (often using non-linear programming and presenting high difficulty for solvers). In community fba (cfba), the exchange of metabolites between species, the biomass, relative fitness, and competitive ability of each species affects metabolic flux within the community as well as within each individual species[4,5,6].",2015
UCSC," Current methods of codon optimization work by substituting less frequent codons for a particular amino acid to a more commonly used codon. While this method of codon optimization results in increased protein yields, recent evidence suggests that it alters protein function. We hypothesize that codon frequencies in orfs model translational speed, are non-trivial to protein folding, and therefore play a major role in codon optimization. Focus provides the end user with a foundation to visualize the rate of protein synthesis as the nascent polypeptide exits the ribosome, granting potential insight to the underlying mechanics of protein folding. Focus has the potential to identify detrimental single nucleotide polymorphisms that may be pivotal to the encoded protein's fold and serves as an extremely useful tool for protein engineering.",2015

The assumption that the most frequent synonymous codon is also the most efficiently translated codon is not necessarily true when it is considered that a typical or average transcript is not one that is likely to have a higher than average translation efficiency. Instead, these transcripts contain codons that best match the trna pools in the cell. These trna pools can be estimated by the number of trna genes that have an anticodon  which corresponds to a given codon. This approach is known as the trna adaptation index (tai)1 when used to assess the translation efficiency of a coding sequence.",2016

However, we find that many biologists, especially ‘future biologists’ are still struggling with a vast amount of scientific computation software. But most of seem to require special knowledge about programming or other things that we might not be familiar with, thus making it pretty hard to get our hands dirty before it gets frustrating. And thus nεtro is born, to help you design and explore the property of your own gene transcription network. Most importantly, nεtro enables you to manipulate the parameters in the model and get the response of the network in real time!",2017

By interfacing deeprotein with our genetic algorithm gaia, we – for the first time - established a fully closed, in silico evolution cycle driven by an intelligent network. We used aigem to successfully modulate the catalytic efficiency of β-lactamases, thereby even producing variants which highly outperform the wild type enzyme. To demonstrate aigem’s ability for generating functionality de novo, we created a novel, highly efficient β-galactosidase purely by in silico evolution of a β-glucuronidase parental sequence.

Sheffield," If the signal is 'high' it will have a set voltage greater than the off state, for our purposes the high voltage is 3.3v and the low voltage is 0v or ground. A potential divider is used in order to assess the amount of light hitting the diode. This is done by connecting a digital 3.3v signal to one side of a photodiode in reverse bias with a 10k ohm resistor in series and then grounding the other side (digital low state). This analogue signal can then be processed by the microcontroller and give us data on how much light has been scattered by the sample. This means instead of wiring every individual diode to microcontroller, the number of wires required decreases dramatically by soldering them together into a grid.",2017

UNIFI," As the ensemble resides within the google cloud theatre, it is necessary to convey the output to the system proper: without yielding an inch on security, we found web interfaces to be an extremely more convenient option for the general user than ssh-based transfers, especially in light of the open nature of this project. Therefore, two instruments are brought in to feed every other section: nginx (1.10.3) and php (7.0). Due to the extremely lightweight nature of this task, no php framework was employed to accomplish this step. While more recent libraries were available, such as phpspreadsheet, they broke compatibility with previous office excel versions as to ensure a higher code quality, and many are far from being as stable or complete. This is the python (3.5.3) section, with python-midi playing as the first cello: released under the mit license, it allows us to actually write musical instrument digital interface files (midis!).",2017
UNOTT," One solution to this problem was to conduct the verification process through software; this meant reading the spectra into a fluorescence reader to generate a range of data points which could be graphed and then visually compared pixel by pixel or directly compared. Another issue the team faced is identifying whether key.coli was a user friendly product. In order to test how user's would respond to having to use key.coli in practice, a virtual every day environment was developed within unity which showed a person's everyday life. Actions were monitored and fed back to the team to see how easy it was to operate key.coli. This graph could be compared using an image similarity algorithm to check the difference between a data set from a certain time point to another data set from another time point.this was very important to the project as it allowed us to compare the fluorescence spectra of one random construction at different time periods.",2017

Cornell," To keep costs low, we built our system out of a ten dollar camera and a raspberry pi. This allows us to properly image and track fluorescence to a reasonable degree without the need for expensive lab equipment like plate readers or spectrofluorometers. Using opencv, an open-source package for computer vision, we created software to track the fluorescent signal in our frame, efficiently eliminate noise, and record and send the measured intensity to a web server which tracks the readings. While our optics are designed for rxrfp, our software works for any wavelength and is capable of cheaply identifying and quantifying localized fluorescence in a wide variety of environments, providing a powerful tool for labs on a budget. While the optical filter on the camera removes most of the stray and excitation light, there is still a noticeable background.",2017
