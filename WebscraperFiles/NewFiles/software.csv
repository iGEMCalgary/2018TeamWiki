Bologna,"We develop a matlab tool to analyze such kind of bacterium imagine that can be acquired in different format (jpg, bpm, tiff). For each segmented bacteria the software computes the size in pixel, the mean and standard deviation of intensity florescence. Main frame the algorithm reads fluorescence images and converts it into a ""black and white"" one. In the next step the global threshold is computed in order to convert an intensity image to a binary image using otsus method. The image is then ready to be scanned, pixel by pixel, to detect bacteria (cluster  of pixels) and obtain informations about their area, fluorescence mean and standard deviation.",2008
Edinburgh,"Background many software tools (such as copasi and simbiology) are available for simulation and analysis of biological circuits using mathematical models. Therefore we developed a web tool called mgec (modeling genetically engineered circuits) to address this issue. Through mgec, one only needs to tell which genes and promoters are assembled in order to form their gene circuit - a preliminary model in sbml format will be automatically generated for the circuit. Design of mgec database a key technology used for engineering gene circuit in synthetic biology research and the igem competition is the recombination of genes with different promoters. Therefore the focus of mgec is also on the promoters which link the signal, transcription factor (tf) with the regulated genes.",2008
Newcastle University,"One person was lead developer for each module, but the developers worked in the same lab, and had frequent formal and informal discussions in order to develop software which works together and provides the necessary functionality. Constraints define whether these parts can fit together. The workbench takes a user defined structure, together with a desired behavior, and presents this to the evolutionary algorithm. The evolutionary algorithm evolves potential solutions, starting with the provided structure. It generates a range of potential solutions by requesting different parts from the parts repository, assembling them according to information retrieved from the constraints repository, and assessing the fitness value of the mutated circuit based upon how well this satisfies the objective.",2008

To analyse the wikis, we have implemented an algorithm that uses statistically improbable phrases (sip) to try and extract the meaning of a text, an approach which has been used recently by amazon to find relationships between books. An sip is a word that appears with a higher frequency in your target (whether it is a book, or an igem wiki) than in a large dataset of background text. More formally: f the frequency of the word in the target: f = o/n (o is the occurence of the word, and n the number of words in the wiki). Our algorithm uses all igem wikis as a background dataset, and then tries to find sips for each individual wiki.",2010

Imperial College London,"It is tempting to think that one could codon optimise a sequence by selectively using an organisms preferred codons. Recent optimisation studies[1] have highlighted the importance of maintaining a diverse codon population in a given coding sequence. This said, the inclusion of rare codons has also been shown to dramatically reduce protein expression e. Solution in our approach to codon optimisation, we attempted to maintain codon diversity while simultaneously limiting rare codon inclusion. This was achieved by weighting codon selection using bias tables obtained from the codon usage database[3].",2011

Minnesota,"Anti-homologous-recombination (and optimization and restriction site checking) sequence analysis program while we are optimizing genes from coffea canephora to biobrick into our yeast-e coli shuttle vector, we came onto an interesting problem. This problem is significant for us, as our two caffeine pathway enzymes, xmt1 and dxmt1, are highly similar (initial sequence similarity of 0.8778 through needleman-wunsch alignment with 16 stretches of long equivalent sequences >=20bp). In order to circumvent this problem, we developed a java program that aligns sequences, looks for stretches of dna 20bp or more, then changes codons (in-frame, of course) of the center amino acid to the next most preferable codon (using a yeast codon usage chart). This way, we can get sequences with sharply decreased likelihood of homologous recombination while keeping the amino acid sequence the same. While we are at it, we made the program also check for and remove restriction sites (specified by the user, referenced in a built-in database).",2012
